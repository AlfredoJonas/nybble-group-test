# Nybble Group Test

This is a project to build a test for a Nybble enterprise. In this opportunity build a Angularjs aplication with a structure of Angular2 because the objective the project you want contract me is to update an app from Angularjs to Angular2, and this is a good way for will make.

## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the repository.

### Install Dependencies

We have two type of dependencies in this project: development tools and application specific packages. They are both managed with npm in package.json as devDependencies and dependencies.

The way for build a Angularjs app with a structure of Angular2 is throug a angular-ts-decorators dependencie with a Typescript language, of rest are development dependencies.

```
npm install
```

## Directory Layout

```
  src/                  --> all of the source files for the application
    app/                --> static app assets
    resources/          --> The media resources to the aplication
    styles/             --> Global styles, like fonts or libraries
    test.ts             --> The main config for run tests
    main.ts             --> main application module
    index.html          --> app layout file (the main html template file of the app)
```

### Running the App

The project comes preconfigured with a local development webserver. It is a webpack-dev-server, that supports hot reload for a typescript files but not for a sass styles.  You can start this webserver with `npm start`.

Now browse to the app at `http://localhost:8080/`.
